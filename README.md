Emotion Detection with OpenCV 🎭
This project uses OpenCV and deep learning to detect human emotions from facial expressions in real-time. The model classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more by analyzing facial landmarks and patterns.

Features:
Real-time emotion detection using webcam or video input
Pre-trained deep learning model for facial expression recognition
Supports a variety of emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.)
Easy-to-use and customizable with OpenCV and Python
Visual feedback with bounding boxes and emotion labels
Tech Stack:
Python 🐍
OpenCV 📷
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning 🧠
Usage:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project: python emotion_detection.py
Point your webcam to see real-time emotion detection!
